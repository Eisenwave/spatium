/**
 * <p>
 *     Package consisting mostly of utility classes that help finding relations between various geometrical objects.
 * </p>
 * This includes, but is not limited to: <ul>
 *     <li>Testing for collisions/intersections between objects -> {@link net.grian.spatium.coll.Collisions}</li>
 *     <li>Ray casting or finding entry/exit of a ray in an object -> {@link net.grian.spatium.coll.Rays}</li>
 *     <li>Finding object normals; reflections of vectors on surfaces -> {@link net.grian.spatium.coll.Normals}</li>
 *     <li>Projecting objects onto other objects -> {@link net.grian.spatium.coll.Projections}</li>
 *     <li>Measuring distances in various ways -> {@link net.grian.spatium.coll.Distances}</li>
 *     <li>Intersections between objects (f.e. Plane,Plane->Ray) -> {@link net.grian.spatium.coll.Intersections}</li>
 * </ul>
